## Travel Dairy App

Let's start from the basics. Ilari wants to be able to keep track of his experiences on his flight journeys.

He wants to be able to save diary entries which contain:

 - The date of the entry
 - Weather conditions (good, windy, rainy or stormy)
 - Visibility (good, ok or poor)
  - Free text detailing the experience
